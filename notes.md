The text form is very easily parsed

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSM7653734&targ=self&view=brief&form=text

targ=gsm and targ=gse are very different

difference between GSM and GSE?

GSE is the parent description
GSM are like runs
	but could some runs be mutant and some be WT?
	I think so

Are some of these WT and some mutant?

!Series_summary = There is a marked dysregulation of the proteome as organisms ag
e. Regulation of both protein production and degradation can become dysregulated
as an organism ages. However, whether and how aging-responsive transcripts are se
lectively translated is unknown. Changes in the composition of the ribosome can l
ead to differential binding and translation of specific transcripts. Here we exam
ined the role of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) methylation in maintaining appropriate tran
slation of age-dependent transcripts. In a directed RNAi screen we identified the
 18S rRNA N6â€™-dimethyl adenosine (m6,2A) methyltransferase, dimt-1, as a regulato
r of C. elegans lifespan and stress resistance. Lifespan extension induced by dim
t-1 deficiency required a functional germline and the Rag GTPase, raga-1, which l
inks amino acid sensing to mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) complex (mTORC)
1. Using an auxin-inducible degron tagged version of dimt-1 we demonstrate that D
IMT-1 functions in the worms germline after mid-life to regulate lifespan. We fur
ther found that knock-down of dimt-1 leads to selective translation of transcript
s important for stress resistance and lifespan regulation in the C. elegans germl
ine in mid-life. Our findings highlight a new role for rRNA modifications such as
 m6,2A and ribosome heterogeneity more broadly, in maintaining appropriate transl
ation later in life to promote healthy aging.

!Series_overall_design = To investigate the role of germline dimt-1 in regulating C. elegans lifespan, we IP'd FLAG-tagged germline ribosomes from dimt-1 knock down and control worms. The purified ribosome-bound transcripts were then subject to mRNA-seq. As a control, we also performed mRNA-seq on dimt-1 knock down and control worms using total RNA from whole-worm lysates.
