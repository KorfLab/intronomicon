# GSE list #

| GSE ID       | what they study                                     | what they do 
|:------------:|:---------------------------------------------------:|:-------------
| GSE53359     | evolutionary difference of C.elegan and C. briggsae | 1 They use mass spetrometry, and food resources are different for group A and B. A are light E.col5598i. B are heavy E.coli <br> 2 Embryo shall be non-wt. Well,they also said they knock some daf-16 to study FOXO uh in embryo
| GSE55988     | dietary restriction on longevity                    | 1 They use different knock gene out to test different environments. There are way more in original experiment. <br> 2 In this GSE, there might not don't have the insult there, btw shall be different insult in others. Like some are emerge in oil.
| GSE57109     | germline biology with removing some gene            | 1 They use N2 as wildtype. <br> 2 They study fog-2 and fem-3 gene knocked C.elegan and dissect those gonald.
| GSE57351     | parantel RNA contribution in embryo?                | 1 N2 shall be wildtype. CB4856 is name the hawaii strain. <br> 2 fog2 is female. CB4856 is male.
| GSE58141     | mRNA turnover mechanism                             | 1 similar as 57351; RNA oocyte, sperm stuff. <br> 2 This one is kinda easy to determine. I am pretty sure about this.
| GSE58931     | longevity and metabolism of energy                  | 1 CA-AAK-2 is AMPK activation (CA-AAK-2) <br> 2  CRTC-1 is cyclic regulated transcriptional coactivator (CRTC) <br> 3 S76A and S179A is serine xx. Blocking phosphorylation of CRTC-1 at conserved AMPK target sites, serines 76 and 179, renders it refractory to AMPK regulation and constitutively nuclear. 
| GSE59705     | SPK-1 and alternative splicing                      | 1 SPK-1 is SR protein kinase SPK-1.
| GSE59715     | three dimensional?? not quite understand            | 1 not quite sure the Bxxx stuff, might be some dose difference, btw shall this be considered as insult difference? 
| GSE60063     | food mechanism on removal of one gene               | 1 there is a lot different names and GSEs in this paper, but they all could able to figure out in the paper
| GSE60825     | transient hypoxia, RNAi, ELT-2                      | 1 not a lot GSMs, but mixed stage from paper 
| GSE61581     | tdp-1 and dsDNA conservation?                       | 1 they use IP and high-throught sequencing
| GSE61733     | RtcB RNA and unfolded protein response              | 1 can't really figure out what's Tm stand for, suppose to be some insult
| GSE63528     | transcriptional drift and aging                     | 1 there are different day of RNA sequencing and food treatment 
| GSE63823     | circRNAs and specifc stage                          | 1 mock treatment are control <br> 2 RNases-R are remove linear RNA from mock sample?
| GSE64401     | innate immune response of nematodes                 | 1 different pathogen as insult or food <br> 2 WT N2 as genotype
| GSE54672     | NMD mutant in C.elegan                              | 1 gon --> gonald , sgo? --> somantic and gonald? glp4 --> mutant
