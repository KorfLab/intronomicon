# GSE list #

| GSE ID       | what they study                                     | what they do 
|:------------:|:---------------------------------------------------:|:-------------
| GSE53359     | evolutionary difference of C.elegan and C. briggsae | 1 They use mass spetrometry, and food resources are different for group A and B. A are light E.col5598i. B are heavy E.coli <br> 2 Embryo shall be non-wt. Well,they also said they knock some daf-16 to study FOXO uh in embryo
| GSE55988     | dietary restriction on longevity                    | 1 They use different knock gene out to test different environments. There are way more in original experiment. <br> 2 In this GSE, there might not don't have the insult there, btw shall be different insult in others. Like some are emerge in oil.
| GSE57109     | germline biology with removing some gene            | 1 They use N2 as wildtype. <br> 2 They study fog-2 and fem-3 gene knocked C.elegan and dissect those gonald.
| GSE57351     | parantel RNA contribution in embryo?                | 1 N2 shall be wildtype. CB4856 is name the hawaii strain. <br> 2 fog2 is female. CB4856 is male.
| GSE58141     | mRNA turnover mechanism                             | 1 similar as 57351; RNA oocyte, sperm stuff. <br> 2 This one is kinda easy to determine. I am pretty sure about this.
