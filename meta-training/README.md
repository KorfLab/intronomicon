Metadata Training Protocol
==========================

## Setup ##

1. Clone the intronomicon repo
2. Create a directory in `meta-training` with your name
3. Put a `README.md` in your named directory for personal notes

## Procedure ##

1. Open `meta-training/index.html` in your favorite browser
2. Examine the pre-generated guide-tree
3. Peruse the text describing the experimental series
4. Drag the GSM* files into appropriate groups
	- You may need to "Add New Group"
	- You may need to "Remove Group"
	- Note that group names don't matter, but should be unique
5. Use the drop-down menus to annotate each group
6. Record your changes with "Save Changes to New File"
7. Move the file from `~/Downloads` to `meta-training/{your_name}` 

At the end of the session, make sure to add, commit, and push your files.

## Tips ##

- Use your `README.md` to note oddities for discussion
- Use your `README.md` to remember which files you have and haven't done
- Create aliases in your `~/Downloads` to make loading and saving faster
