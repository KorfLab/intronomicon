<li>Series_title: RNA-seq analysis of young adult daf-18(ok480) and control worms
<li>Series_summary: RNA-seq analysis was used to identify the gene expression changes in male and hermaphroditie when daf-18 is lost. Based on these sequencing data, the genes that were up-regulated or down-regulated by at least 2 times (|log2 (folding change) | ≥ 1 and padj ≤ 0.05) were analyzed. The analysis of these differentially expressed genes' pathway and gene ontology (GO) enrichment shows that the influence of different genders after daf-18 deletion is enriched to some signal pathways, including longevity and protein degradation pathway in endoplasmic reticulum, etc.
<li>Series_overall_design: The mRNA profile changes of each sex when daf-18 is lost, were generated by deep sequencing. Use Illumina Gallx
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
