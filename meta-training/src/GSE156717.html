<li>Series_title: Cell-type-specific profiling of loaded miRNAs from Caenorhabditis elegans reveals spatial and temporal flexibility in Argonaute loading [RNA-seq] #-# Cell-type-specific profiling of loaded miRNAs from Caenorhabditis elegans reveals spatial and temporal flexibility in Argonaute loading
<li>Series_summary: We report the the 'translatome' of the nervous system in c.elegans by immunoprecipitating FLAG- epitope tagged RPL-18 expressed under a nervous system specific promoter. In addition we compared this to the nervous system specific 'translatome' in an alg-2 mutant background. As such we were able to determine the specifc effects of ALG-2 on the nervous sytem gene expression landscape. #-# This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
<li>Series_overall_design: Cell-type spedific polysome complexes were immunoprecipitated using FLAG conjugated magnetic beads. Immunocomplexes were eluted from beads using the FLAG peptide and mRNA purified using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). #-# Refer to individual Series
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing #-# Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing #-# Non-coding RNA profiling by high throughput sequencing
