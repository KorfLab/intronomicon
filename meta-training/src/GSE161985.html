<li>Series_title: mRNAseq of wild type and ets-5 mutant C. elegans BAG neurons #-# Development of specialized sensory neurons engages a nuclear receptor required for functional plasticity
<li>Series_summary: comparative transcriptomics of wild type and ets-5 mutant C. elegans BAG neurons #-# This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
<li>Series_overall_design: BAG neurons were isolated from embryonic preps of wild type and ets-5 mutants using FACS. mRNA for two biological replicates were sequenced using Illumina Hi seq 2500. Fastq files were aligned to ws243 using STAR. Quantification was performed using HTSeq, and differential expression analysis was performed using DESeq2. #-# Refer to individual Series
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing #-# Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing #-# Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing
