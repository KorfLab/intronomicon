<li>Series_title: Exploring the Impact of Cyclodipeptide on Fungal Metabolism: Insights into Membrane and Metabolic Responses [C. elegans] #-# Exploring the Impact of Cyclodipeptide on Fungal Metabolism: Insights into Membrane and Metabolic Responses
<li>Series_summary: This study investigates the effects of cyclodipeptide on fungal and nematode metabolism, specifically focusing on its impact on membrane composition and metabolic responses. Metabolomic profiles of treated and untreated fungal cultures were compared to unravel the molecular changes induced by cyclodipeptide, with a particular emphasis on membrane phospholipids such as monoolein and phosphatidyl ethanolamine, as well as other plasma membrane components like ergosterol and its derivative products. The results reveal significant alterations in the metabolites present in the presence of cyclodipeptide. Specifically, the levels of cyclo (Pro-Tyr) monoolein were found to decrease, while phosphatidyl ethanolamine levels increased. Moreover, the levels of ergosterol and its derivatives were observed to decrease as well. These findings indicate that cyclodipeptide has a profound impact on the metabolic pathways of the fungal system under investigation. The study suggests that cyclodipeptide not only influences membrane phospholipids but may also have broader effects on membrane proteins, cellular signaling, and communication. Furthermore, the observed changes in metabolomic profiles hint at potential alterations in cellular processes beyond membrane composition, possibly involving gene expression and enzyme activity. Understanding the mechanisms behind these effects holds considerable scientific interest and practical implications. The ability of cyclodipeptide to selectively target membrane components presents opportunities for studying and manipulating membrane function in various organisms. Additionally, the discovery of new bioactive natural products like cyclodipeptide opens avenues for developing innovative therapeutics or agricultural agents. Further research is needed to fully comprehend the intricate mechanisms underlying the observed effects of cyclodipeptide on fungal metabolism. #-# This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
<li>Series_overall_design: The worms were synchronized using a bleaching solution (0.5 M NaOH and 1.2% NaClO). Then, the obtained embryos or L1 stage larvae were exposed to 0.25 mg mL-1 Cyclo (Pro-Tyr) solution for 24 hours at 20ÂºC, and the effects of the chemical on survival rate, lifespan, and gene expression were measured. #-# Refer to individual Series
