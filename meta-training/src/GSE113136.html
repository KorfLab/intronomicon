<li>Series_title: Differential expression analysis of wildtype, atfs-1(tm4919) and zip-3(gk3164) mutant with next generation sequencing
<li>Series_summary: ZIP-3 has been shown to repress the mitochondrial-UPR response. To identify genes repressed by ZIP-3, we compared transcript profiles from wildtype, atfs-1(tm4919) and zip-3(gk3164) worms raised on control RNAi or spg-7 RNAi
<li>Series_overall_design: RNA samples were prepared from wild-type(wt) and zip-3(gk3164)(mutant) worms fed either control RNAi or spg-7 RNAi. Worms were synchronized by bleaching, raised on NGM plates seeded with control RNAi or spg-7 RNAi till L4 stage and then harvested. Each experiment was performed in triplicate indicated as 1,2 and 3.
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
