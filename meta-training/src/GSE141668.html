<li>Series_title: Transcriptional analysis effect of excess sugar and lipid on the growth and development of Caenorhabditis elegan
<li>Series_summary: Purpose：We used transcriptome sequencing to study the mechanism of sugar and lipid excesses on nematode growth and development. #-# Methods：Nematodes grew to L4 phase and collected nematodes from different treatment groups, including control group without any treatment, 400 mM sucrose, 500 ug/ml stearic acid, co-treatment with sucrose and stearic acid, and co-treatment with resveratrol-sucrose-stearic acid, 3 replicates per group. Extract total RNA, detect RNA quality, library preparation, sequencing, and analyze data #-# Results:Reads were obtained for each sample using Illumina Hiseq X Ten sequencing. After discarding the low-quality reads, corresponding to 48 million clean reads obtained from sequencing were mapped on the reference genome of C. elegans (GCF_000002985.6). High Pearson's correlation coefficients of FPKM distribution between the three biological replicates for each sample were detected (R2 = 0.93-0.99, P < 0.001) , reflecting the robustness of our library preparation from nematodes’ RNA samples.Compared with control group, there were 905 DEGs in the sucrose group , of which 387 genes were upregulated and 518 genes were downregulated. Similarly, there were 698 DEGs in the stearic acid group , including 367 upregulated and 331 downregulated DEGs. Compared with control group, there were 1014 DEGs in group SUC-STE, including 476 upregulated DEGs, and 538 downregulated DEGs. Moreover, in contrast to the sucrose-stearic acid group, there were 10 DEGs after treated with resveratrol, including 5 upregulated DEGs and 5 downregulated DEGs.
<li>Series_overall_design: Deep-sequencing using Illumina, in triplicate, yielded L4 stage nematode mRNA expression profiles without treatment, sugar and lipid treatment alone, sugar and lipid co-treatment, and resveratrol-sugar-lipid co-treatment.
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
