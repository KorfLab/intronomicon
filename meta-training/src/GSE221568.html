<li>Series_title: N-Glycosylated Intestinal Protein BCF-1 Shapes Microbial Colonization by Binding Bacteria via its Fimbrial Protein
<li>Series_summary: We wondered if the innate immune response was not activated in the bcf-1(ylf1) mutant. We prpared wild(N2) and bcf-1(ylf1) mutant (adults) for RNA-seq.
<li>Series_overall_design: RNA-seq was done with three biological replicates that were independently generated, collected, and processed. Adult animals [wild-type N2 and bcf-1(ylf1) mutant] growing on E. coli-OP50 were collected.
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
