<li>Series_title: Effects of csr-1 knockdown on gene expression and mRNA splicing
<li>Series_summary: The Integrator is an evolutionarily conserved protein complex that functions to process the 3’ maturation of small nuclear RNA molecules that are an essential part of the spliceosome. We performed a genome-wide RNAi screen in the C. elegans system and identified csr-1 as an essential gene required for this process. Knockdown of csr-1 activates an snRNA misprocessing reporter and causes aberrant 3’ cleavage of several endogenous snRNA transcripts. Using whole-transcriptome RNA sequencing, we evaluated the effects of csr-1 knockdown via RNAi relative to empty vector control and found that knockdown of csr-1 causes aberrant expression of various snRNA transcripts along with significant changes to alterantive splicing of ~400 transcripts. Overall, this experiment identified the role of csr-1 as a novel regulator of snRNA processing and profiled its impact on gene expression and alternatively splicing at the transcriptome level.
<li>Series_overall_design: Total RNA was prepared from gravid young adult Caenorhabditis elegans with three biological replicates per group and sent to NovoGene for PE150 sequencing. Sequencing library were constructured with oligo-dT enrichment. Gene expression data were analyzed by DEGSeq with Alternative splicing data analyzed by rMATS.
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
