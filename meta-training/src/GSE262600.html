<li>Series_title: RNA-seq analysis of young adult fed 5mM tryptophan and control worms
<li>Series_summary: RNA-seq analysis was used to identify the gene expression changes of young adults after feeding 5mM tryptophan for 36 hours from the L4 period. Based on these sequencing data, the genes that were up-regulated or down-regulated by at least 2 times (|log2 (folding change) | ≥ 1 and padj ≤ 0.05) were analyzed. The analysis of these differentially expressed genes' pathway and gene ontology (GO) enrichment shows that the influence of different genders after feeding 5mM tryptophan is enriched to some signal pathways, including longevity、ribosome and protein degradation pathway in endoplasmic reticulum, etc.
<li>Series_overall_design: When tryptophan was fed, mRNA profile changes for each group were generated by deep sequencing. Use Illumina Gallx
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
