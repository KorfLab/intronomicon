<li>Series_title: Characterization of the genes that were regulated by feeding with Lactococcus lactis strains
<li>Series_summary: In the present study, we investigated the effect of Lactobacillus lactis on healthspan using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model animal. The healthspan of the adult C. elegans fed the mixture of E. coli OP50 and Lactobacillus lactis NBRC 100913 or NBRC 12007 strains was significantly longer than that of animals fed sole OP50 (control). Transcriptional profiling comparing Lactobacillus lactis- and control-fed animals suggested that genes related to “locomotion” were upregulated by Lactobacillus lactis.
<li>Series_overall_design: Transcriptional profiling of three-day-old worms that were fed OP50 or the mixture of OP50 and Lactobacillus lactis NBRC 100913 or NBRC 12007 for five days, by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq.
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
