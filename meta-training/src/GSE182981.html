<li>Series_title: Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type animal fed normal and high glucose diets at different age
<li>Series_summary: Metabolic diseases are strongly associated with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. Upon ER stress, the unfolded protein response (UPR) is activated to limit cellular damage. However, escalating cellular UPR response weakens with age. Here, we show that 5-day-old Caenorhabditis elegans fed a bacteria diet with 2% glucose (high glucose diet, HGD-5) extend their lifespan while shortening the lifespan of 1-day-old (HGD-1) animals. We observed a metabolic shift in HGD-1 as glucose and fertility synergistically prolonged the lifespan of HGD-5, independently of DAF-16. Notably, we identified that UPR stress sensors ATF-6 and PEK-1 extended the longevity of HGD-5 worms, while the ire-1 ablation drastically increased HGD-1 lifespan. Based on these observations, we postulate that HGD activates the otherwise quiescent UPR in aged worms to overcome ageing-related stress and restore ER homeostasis. In contrast, young animals subjected to HGD provokes unresolved ER stress, conversely leading to a detrimental stress response.
