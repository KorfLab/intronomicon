<li>Series_title: Polyketide synthase-derived sphingolipids determine microbiota-mediated protection against pathogens inC. elegans
<li>Series_summary: Protection against pathogens is a major function of the gut microbiota. Although bacterial natural products have emerged as crucial components of host-microbiota interactions, their exact role in microbiota-mediated protection is largely unexplored. We addressed this knowledge gap with the nematodeCaenorhabditis elegansand its microbiota isolatePseudomonas fluorescensMYb115 that is known to protect againstBacillus thuringiensis (Bt) infection. We find that MYb115-mediated protection depends on sphingolipids that are derived from an iterative type I polyketide synthase (PKS), thereby describing a noncanonical pathway of bacterial sphingolipid production. We provide evidence that MYb115-derived sphingolipids affectC. eleganstolerance to Bt infection by altering host sphingolipid metabolism. This work establishes sphingolipids as structural outputs of bacterial PKS and highlights the role of microbiota-derived sphingolipids in host protection against pathogens.
