<li>Series_title: Characterization of the genes that were regulated by feeding with B. subtilis (natto) strains
<li>Series_summary: In the present study, we investigated the effect of Bacillus subtilis var. natto on lifespan using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model animal. The lifespan of the adult C. elegans fed Bacillus subtilis var. natto MI-OMU01 strain was significantly longer than that of animals fed OP50 (control). Transcriptional profiling comparing MI-OMU01- and control-fed animals suggested that genes related to “innate immune system” were upregulated by MI-OMU01.
<li>Series_overall_design: Transcriptional profiling of three-day-old worms that were fed OP50 or B. subtilis (natto) MI-OMU01 for one day, by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq.
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
