<li>Series_title: mRNA-seq of wild-type(N2), hlh-11 knock-out(KO) and hlh-11 over-expression(OE) worms
<li>Series_summary: Purpose: Comparing the transcriptome of wild-type(N2), hlh-11 knock-out and hlh-11 over-expression worms to identify genes with differential expression. #-# Methods: For each condition, two replicates were examined. For each sample, approximately 2,000 synchronized young adult worms were collected and resuspended in TRIzon Reagent (CW0580, CWBIO). Total RNA was isolated by chloroform extraction, followed by isopropanol precipitation. Sequencing was performed using HiSeq2500. The clean reads were aligned to WBcel235 genomes with TopHat2. Gene differential expression was analyzed using DEseq2. A threshold of p < 0.05 was set to determine differentially expressed genes. Induction (KO_up or OE_up) or suppression (KO_down or OE_down) of genes were obtained through comparing gene expressions in hlh-11 KO or OE worms to wild-type N2. #-# Results: >86% reads were uniquely mapped. 2637 genes were significantly up regulated and 2845 genes were significantly down regulated in hlh-11 knock-out worms compared to wild-type. 107 genes were significantly up regulated and 237 genes were significantly down regulated in hlh-11 over-expression worms compared to wild-type. #-# Conclusions: This study revealed the genes transcriptionally regulated by hlh-11.
