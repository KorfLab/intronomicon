<li>Series_title: Genome-wide expression analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans AXIN mutant
<li>Series_summary: Purpose: The goal of this study is to identify differentially expressed genes in pry-1/Axin mutant compare to N2 wild-type (WT). #-# Our study represents the first analysis of Axin transcriptome in C. elegans and facilitates investigations of axin mediated processes.
<li>Series_overall_design: Whole animal total RNA was extracted from L1 synchronized worms and mRNA profiles of WT and pry-1(mu38) animals were generated by paired end deep sequencing, using Illumina HISeq 2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed using ce6 with Burrowsâ€“Wheeler Aligner (BWA) followed by eXpress to estimate transcript abundances. Differentially-expressed genes were called at a false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05% using the DESeq package in R.
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
