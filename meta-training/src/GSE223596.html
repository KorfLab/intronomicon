<li>Series_title: S-adenosylmethionine synthases specify distinct H3K3me3 populations and gene expression patterns during heat stress [RNA-seq: sams-4 RNAi, Heat shock] #-# S-adenosylmethionine synthases specify distinct H3K3me3 populations and gene expression patterns during heat stress
<li>Series_summary: We find that two SAM synthases in C. elegans, SAMS-1 and SAMS-3/4, contribute differently to modification of H3K4me3, gene expression and survival in the heat stress response. Our data showing differential SAM provisioning to distinct groups of methylated targets based on SAM synthase source suggests that determining how methyl donors are provided will broaden insight into 1CC functions in aging and stress. #-# This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
