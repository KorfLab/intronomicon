<li>Series_title: RNAseq of C. elegans grown with different bacteria isolates
<li>Series_summary: RNAseq was carried out to compare the gene expression profiles of the worms grown with individual bacteria to understand the bacterial effect
<li>Series_overall_design: C. elegans was grown with Chryseobacterium sp. CHNTR56, Comamonas sp. 12022 or E. coli OP50
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
