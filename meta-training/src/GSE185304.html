<li>Series_title: MSTR-1::FLAG and N2 #-# Effect of mstr-1 knockout on global mRNA expression in C. elegans
<li>Series_summary: This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below. #-# We isolate and sequence total RNA from wild type (N2) and mstr-1(on33) worms and compare global mRNA expression to understand the mstr-1 null phenotype #-# Significantly DE genes are then compared to transcripts bound by MSTR-1 from CLIP-seq data co-uploaded with this dataset
<li>Series_overall_design: Refer to individual Series #-# Worms were grown to L4 stage and RNA from whole worms was extracted and sequenced by TCAG at SickKids Hospital. 3 biological replicates are included
<li>Series_type: Other #-# Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
