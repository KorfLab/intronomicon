<li>Series_title: Characterization of the genes that were regulated by feeding nisin
<li>Series_summary: In the present study, we investigated the effects of feeding nisin using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model animal. The lifespan of the adult C. elegans fed nisin was significantly longer than that of uninfected animals (control). Transcriptional profiling comparing fed- and unfed animals suggested that genes related to defence responses were upregulated by nisin.
<li>Series_overall_design: Transcriptional profiling of four-day-old worms that were fed or unfed nisin for one day, by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq.
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
