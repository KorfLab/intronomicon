<li>Series_title: Transcriptomics of C. chinensis and E. ulmoides treated aged C. elegans
<li>Series_summary: The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans was treated with extracts of the Traditional Chinese Medicine plants Cuscuta chinensis and Eucommia ulmoides from the L4 stage. In aged worms (on the 7th and 12th day of adulthood) different health parameters were determined. Besides the prolongation of lifespan, we found that C. chinensis improved the swimming behavior, pharyngeal pumping rate, stress resistance, mechanosensation and memory of aged C. elegans. Furthermore, the extract treatment reduced the autofluorescence, which is a known biomarker of ageing. Thus, we concluded that C. chinensis is an overall healthspan enhancer. In contrast, the E. ulmoides extract specifically enhanced the lifespan and stress resistance of aged C. elegans, but did not improve any other health aspect. To reveal the mechanism behind the healthspan enhancing effects of C. chinensis, the transcriptome of treated and untreated C. elegans on the 12th day of adulthood was analysed. For comparison purposes, E. ulmoides treated nematodes were included in the analysis.
<li>Series_overall_design: Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for C. elegans treated with C. chinensis or E. ulmoides. DMSO treated nematodes were used as control. The treatment of nematodes took place from L4 until the 12th day of adulthood. Five biological repeats were prepared per treatment group.
