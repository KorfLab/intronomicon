<li>Series_title: Purification-sequencing of RNA super-assemblies.
<li>Series_summary: C. elegans oogenesis arrest offers a unique and biologically relevant opportunity to investigate how condensation reorganizes the transcriptome in the context of cellular adaptation to quiescence. To investigate how RNA self-organization into condensates controls mRNA cytosolic stoichiometries depending on sequence identity and translational activity, we adapted a new Fluorescent Activated Particle Sorting (FAPS) method to selectively sort germline P-bodies from C. elegans oocytes. Fluorescently labelled in oocytes, GFP:CAR-1 P-bodies were formaldehyde fixed and FAPS sorted from whole animal extracts by their size and fluorescence. #-# We then performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of oocyte P-bodies, dissected oocytes and whole animal extracts.
