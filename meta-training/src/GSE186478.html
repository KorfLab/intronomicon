<li>Series_title: RNA Sequencing of C. elegans control and mutant worms after 24 hour P. aeruginosa infection
<li>Series_summary: Purpose: After infection there was dendrite degeneration in the mutant animals . To decipher the mechanism responsible and the changes in the gene expression of mutant worms #-# Methods: Control and mutant worms were exposed at young adult stage to P.aeruginosa PA14 infection for 24 hours. Total RNA was extracted and RNA sequencing was done following standard protocols #-# Results: Detailed analysis of the transcriptomic data show that immune genes were significantly upregulated. #-# Conclusions: This study showed the role of pathogenic infection in the life span modulation
<li>Series_overall_design: C. elegans RNA seq of young adults of control and mutant worms after 24 hour P.aeruginosa PA14 infection in triplicate, using Illumina platform
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
