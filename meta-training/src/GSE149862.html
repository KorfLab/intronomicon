<li>Series_title: RNA Sequencing of unc-30(ok613) and wild type (WT) N2 C. elegans in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA14) infection
<li>Series_summary: Purpose: To uncover immune mediated genes and pathways by Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection that are modulated by the homeodomain PITX1/UNC-30, which plays a vital role in the GABAergic signaling in C. elegans #-# Methods: RNA was extracted from synchronized Pseudomonas aeruginosa infected L4 stage unc-30(ok613) and WT using Qiagen extraction kits and following standard methods. The animals were grown on OP50 at 20 C and infected at 25 C. #-# Results: RNA seq analyses shows enriched and signficant Pseudomonas aeruginosa mediated upregulated immune, neuropeptide and metabolism genes and pathways that are dependent of GABAergic signaling #-# Conclusions: Our study uncovered GABAgergic signaling to be modulator of the innate immunity in C elegans during Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection
<li>Series_overall_design: RNA seq profiles of Pseudomonas aeruginosa infected L4-stage unc-30(ok613) and wild type (WT) C. elegans animals were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform.
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
