<li>Series_title: High power of 0.26 Terahertz radiation induced genes involved in immune system and nervous system changes in the nematode Caenorhabditis Elegans
<li>Series_summary: The biological impacts of terahertz (THz) waves as well as their biosafety have emerged as a new area of concern with the gradual application of terahertz radiation. In recent years, many studies have been conducted to investigate the influence of terahertz on living organisms, such as animals or cell cultures; however, the biological effects of terahertz waves have not yet been fully revealed. In this study, Caenorhabditis elegans (C. elegans), one of the most acceptable model organisms for studying various forms of ionizing and non-ionizing radiation exposure was used to evaluate the effects of terahertz waves on the entire organism. In this study, the integration of transcriptome sequencing and behavioral tests of C. elegans revealed that high-power THz irradiation damaged the epidermal ultrastructures, inhibited the expression of cuticle collagen gene to impair the movement of C. elegans. Our findings offer fresh perspectives on the biological impacts of high-power THz radiation that could cause epidermal damage and provoke a systemic response.
<li>Series_overall_design: To investigate the effect of THz on C. elegans, we performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of 3 THz treated and 3 control primary C.elegans
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
