<li>Series_title: RNA-seq data for: Anti-retroviral treatment with zidovudine alters pyrimidine metabolism, reduces translation, and extends healthy longevity via ATF-4
<li>Series_summary: The human population is aging, and the need for interventions to slow progression of age-related diseases (geroprotective interventions) is growing. Repurposing compounds already used clinically, usually at modified doses, allows for rapid implementation of geroprotective pharmaceuticals. Here we find the anti-retroviral nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) zidovudine robustly extends lifespan and healthspan in C. elegans, independent of electron transport chain impairment or ROS accumulation. Rather, zidovudine treatment modifies pyrimidine metabolism and transcripts related to proteostasis. Testing regulators of mitochondrial stress and proteostasis shows that lifespan extension is dependent on activating transcription factor 4 (ATF-4). ATF-4 regulates longevity induced by mitochondrial stress, and specifically communication between mitochondrial and cytosolic translation. Translation is reduced in zidovudine-treated worms, also dependent on ATF-4. Finally, we show ATF-4-dependent lifespan extension induced by didanosine, another NRTI. Altogether, our work elucidates the geroprotective effects of NRTIs such as zidovudine in vivo, via reduction of translation and ATF-4.
