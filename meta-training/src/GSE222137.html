<li>Series_title: RNA-binding protein complex AMG-1/SLRP-1 mediates germline development and spermatogenesis by maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in Caenorhabditis elegans [RNA-seq] #-# RNA-binding protein complex AMG-1/SLRP-1 mediates germline development and spermatogenesis by maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis in Caenorhabditis elegans
<li>Series_summary: The mechanisms of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs)-mediated post-transcriptional regulation of pre-existing mRNAs, which is essential for spermatogenesis, remains poorly understood. Here, we identify a germline-specific mitochondrial RBP AMG-1, a homolog of mammalian LRPPRC, required for spermatogenesis in C. elegans. amg-1 mutation hinders germline development without affecting somatic development and leads to the aberrant mitochondrial morphology and structure associated with mitochondrial dysfunctions specifically in germline. We demonstrate that AMG-1 is most frequently bound to mtDNA-encoded 12S and 16S ribosomal RNA, the essential components of mitochondrial ribosome, and that 12S rRNA expression mediated by AMG-1 is crucial for germline mitochondrial protein homeostasis. Besides, mitochondrial dysfunction by AMG-1 mutation triggers sperm apoptosis in C. elegans. Furthermore, SLRP-1, the homolog of mammalian SLIRP in C. elegans, interacts with AMG-1 genetically to regulate germline development and reproductive success in C. elegans. Taken together, these findings reveal the novel function of mtRBP in specifically regulating germline development. #-# This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
