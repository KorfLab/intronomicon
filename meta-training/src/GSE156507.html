<li>Series_title: Comparing the transcriptomic responses of Caenorhabditis elegans exposed to cadmium from L1 to L3 versus L1 to L4 stage
<li>Series_summary: Cadmium is a naturally occurring heavy metal, and it is widely used in industry. Due to its persistent toxic effect, cadmium is classified as a category one human carcinogen. Its toxicity has been extensively studied in different organisms, including the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. To investigate the transcriptomic responses following cadmium during early life exposure, C. elegans larval were exposed either from L1 to L3 stage or L1 to L4 stage to 20 µM cadmium chloride. RNAseq was applied to identified the changes of the transcriptome and the pathways which are specific to each stage. Overall, the result revealed that the highest responsive genes in both exposure scenario were linked to oxidative stress, lipid metabolism and ion binding. Additionally, some of these genes are well characterized and linked to specific functions, but some have no known function, however these uncharacterized genes are differentially expressed in both stages as a result of cadmium toxicity.Numerous transcripts were identified in one stage but not at the other. Furthermore, a general trend was observed where a larger number of genes were differentially expressed at L3 stage compared to L4, which suggest stage specific sensitivity in response to cadmium exposure.
<li>Series_overall_design: The global transcriptome was compared in wild type (N2) nematodes which were cultured in the presence or absence of 20 μM of Cadmuim chloride for 27 and 47 hours from L1 stage to L3 stage or L1 to L4 stage.
