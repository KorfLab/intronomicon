<li>Series_title: Transcriptome analysis in the germline of wild-type (WT) n2 worm and nmad-1(ok3133) mutant at 20°C and 25°C. #-# NMAD-1
<li>Series_summary: The goal of RNA-seq is to identify the differential expressed genes in the wild-type worm and nmad-1 mutant worm at 20°C and 25°C respectively. 100 pairs of germlines were extracted and collected from worm tips. Two biological replicates were assigned for each group and the RNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing, using NEXTseq 500 Illumina. We mapped about 20 - 30 million reads per sample to C. elegans genome (build ce10) with bowtie2 workflow. Differential expression genes were identified through EBSeq in RSEM pipeline with 0.05 p value and 1.2 fold change. Our results showed elevated number of misregulated genes in the nmad-1 mutant groups at 25°C. #-# This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
<li>Series_overall_design: Germline mRNA profiles of wilde-type (WT) worm and nmad-1 mutant at 20°C and 25°C were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate, using Nextseq500 #-# Refer to individual Series
