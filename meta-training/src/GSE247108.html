<li>Series_title: Characterization of the genes that were regulated by infection with enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC)
<li>Series_summary: In the present study, we investigated the pathogenicity of infection with enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model animal. The lifespan of the adult C. elegans infeted with ETEC was significantly longer than that of uninfected animals (control). Transcriptional profiling comparing infected- and uninfected animals suggested that genes related to the insulin-like peptide were upregulated by infection with ETEC.
<li>Series_overall_design: Transcriptional profiling of three-day-old worms that were infected or uninfected with ETEC for five days, by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq.
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
