<li>Series_title: Caenorhabditis elegans SynMuv B gene activity is down-regulated during a viral infection
<li>Series_summary: Small RNA pathways regulate eukaryotic antiviral defense. Many of the Caenorhabditis elegans mutations that were identified based on their enhanced RNAi, the synMuv B genes, also emerged from unrelated genetic screens for increased growth factor signaling. The dozen synMuv B genes encode homologues of the mammalian dREAM complex found in nearly all animals and plants, which includes the lin- 35/retinoblastoma oncogene. In wild type animals, a combination of a synMuv A mutation and a synMuv B mutation are required for the Muv phenotype of increased growth factor signaling. But we showed that Orsay virus infection of a single synMuv A mutant can induce a Muv phenotype, unlike the uninfected single synMuv A mutant. This suggests that decreased synMuv B activity, which activates the antiviral RNAi pathway, is a defense response to viral infection. This study presents small RNA deep sequencing analysis of various dREAM complex mutants uncovering distinct siRNA profiles indicative of such an siRNA response.
<li>Series_overall_design: Small RNA high-throughput sequencing was done on wild-type, glp-4, and synmuv mutant strains of C. elegans. Total RNA was isolated from cell lysates from adult C. elegans cultured at 20˚C (glp-4+) or 25˚C (glp-4-). Small RNA data was processed using the tinyRNA pipeline.
