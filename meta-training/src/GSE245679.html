<li>Series_title: Characterization of the genes that were regulated by feeding with Lactococcus kimchii
<li>Series_summary: In the present study, we investigated the effect of Lactococcus kimchii on healthspan using Caenorhabditis elegans as a model animal. The healthspan of the adult C. elegans fed the mixture of E. coli OP50 and Lactococcus kimchii was significantly longer than that of animals fed sole OP50 (control). Transcriptional profiling comparing Lactococcus kimchii- and control-fed animals suggested that genes related to insulin-like signaling pathway were upregulated by Lactococcus kimchii.
<li>Series_overall_design: Transcriptional profiling of three-day-old worms that were fed OP50 or the mixture of OP50 and Lactococcus kimchii for five days, by deep sequencing, using Illumina HiSeq.
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
