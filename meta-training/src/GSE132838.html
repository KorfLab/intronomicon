<li>Series_title: RNA Sequencing of CTRL and Heat Stressed C. elegans [RNA-seq] #-# RNA Sequencing of CTRL and Heat Stressed C. elegans
<li>Series_summary: Three independent replicates of wildtype C. elegans were collected at the L4 stage for RNA. Heat Shock was performed at 35C for 4hrs. #-# This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
<li>Series_overall_design: RNA-seq libraries were generated for L4 wildtype worms to analyze RNA expression in control vs HS worms. #-# Refer to individual Series
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing #-# Non-coding RNA profiling by high throughput sequencing #-# Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
