<li>Series_title: High-fidelity encoding of mechanostimuli by tactile food-sensing neurons requires an ensemble of ion channels
<li>Series_summary: Dopaminergic neurons (expressing Pdat-1::mStrawberry) and serotonergic neurons (expressing Ptph-1::GFP) were purified from C. elegans embryos and larvae. #-# We identified transcripts that were enriched in dopaminergic neurons compared to serotonin neurons.
<li>Series_overall_design: Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data from C. elegans dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons.
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
