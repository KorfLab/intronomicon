<li>Series_title: RNA-seq data for: Reduced ech-6 Expression Attenuates Fat-induced Premature Aging in C. elegans
<li>Series_summary: Deregulated energy homeostasis represents a hallmark of aging and results from complex gene-by-environment interactions. Here, we discovered that reducing the expression of the gene ech-6 encoding enoyl-CoA hydratase remitted fat diet-induced deleterious effects on lifespan in Caenorhabditis elegans, while a basal expression of ech-6 was important to survival under normal dietary conditions. Lipidomics revealed that supplementation of fat in ech-6-silenced worms had marginal effects on lipid profiles, suggesting an alternative fat utilization for energy production. Transcriptomics further suggest a causal relation between the lysosomal pathway, energy production, and the longevity effect conferred by the interaction between ech-6 and high-fat diets. Indeed, enhancing energy production from endogenous fat by overexpressing lysosomal lipase lipl-4 recapitulated the lifespan effects of high-fat diets on ech-6-silenced worms. Collectively, these results reveal that the gene ech-6 modulates metabolic flexibility and may be a target for promoting metabolic health and longevity.
<li>Series_overall_design: In total 16 C. elegans samples were sequenced. Worm samples consisted of total RNA of whole worms, perfomed in quadruplicate for treatment (ech-6 RNAi) and P-80 supplementation.
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
