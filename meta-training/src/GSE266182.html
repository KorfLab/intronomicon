<li>Series_title: Two H3K23 histone methyltransferases, SET-32 and SET-21, function synergistically to promote germline nuclear RNAi, proper endogenous siRNA expression, and germline immortality in Caenorhabditis elegans [RNA-seq]
<li>Series_summary: Nuclear RNAi in C. elegans induces a set of transgenerationally heritable marks of H3K9me3, H3K23me3, and H3K27me3 at the target genes. The function of H3K23me3 in the nuclear RNAi pathway is largely unknown due to the limited knowledge of H3K23 histone methyltransferase (HMT). In this study we identified SET-21 as a novel H3K23 HMT. By taking combined genetic, biochemical, and genomic approaches we found that SET-21 functions synergistically with a previously reported H3K23 HMT SET-32 to deposit H3K23me3 at the native targets of germline nuclear RNAi. We identified a subset of nuclear RNAi targets become transcriptionally activated in the set-21;set-32 double mutant. SET-21 and SET-32 are also required for a robust transgenerational gene silencing induced by exogenous dsRNA. The loss of SET-21 and SET-32 leads to a mortal germline phenotype, similar to mutations of the core nuclear RNAi component. Together, these results support a model in which H3K23 HMTs SET-21 and SET-32 ensure the robustness of germline nuclear RNAi and promotes the germline immortality at a high temperature.
