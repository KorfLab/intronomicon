<li>Series_title: Transcriptomics analysis of C. elegans intestines
<li>Series_summary: To identify new heme responsive genes, we performed transcriptomics analysis on the intestines isolated from worms that were cultured at different concentrations of heme. Results of SMART-seq and gene expression profiling showed that 578 genes were differentially expressed at different heme concentrations.
<li>Series_overall_design: Adult worms that had been cultured with 2, 20, or 400 Î¼M heme were paralyzed and dissected. Intestines from three adult worms were combined into one sample. The mRNA profiles were analyzed by SMARTseq, in triplicate, using Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform.
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
