<li>Series_title: RNA-seq analysis of L1 arrest linc-133(aqz 3) and WT worms
<li>Series_summary: We used RNA-seq analysis to identify changes in gene expression occurring in linc-133 (aqz 3) mutants comparing with that in wild type (N2) worms during L1 arrest stage. Basing on these sequencing data, genes which were up-regulated or down-regulated by at least 2 times( |log2(FoldChange)| ≥ 1 and padj ≤ 0.05) subsequent to WT worms were analyzed. These differentially expressed genes were analyzed for pathway and gene ontology (GO) enrichment, which indicated that the genes influenced by aqz 3 mutation of linc-133 gene were enriched in several significant signaling pathways, including longevity, protein degradation in endoplasmic reticulum pathway, and fat metabolism pathways.
<li>Series_overall_design: mRNA profiles of linc-133(aqz 3) and wild type (WT) were generated by deep sequencing. using Illumina GAllx
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
