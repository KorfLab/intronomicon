<li>Series_title: A DEAD-box helicase drives the partitioning of a pro-differentiation NAB protein into nuclear foci
<li>Series_summary: How cells regulate gene expression in a precise spatiotemporal manner during organismal development is a fundamental question in biology. Although the role of transcriptional condensates in gene regulation has been established, little is known about the function and regulation of these molecular assemblies in the context of animal development and physiology. Here we show that the evolutionarily conserved DEAD-box helicase DDX-23 controls cell fate in Caenorhabditis elegans by binding to and facilitating the condensation of MAB-10, the Caenorhabditis elegans homolog of mammalian NGFI-A-binding (NAB) protein. MAB-10 is a transcriptional cofactor that functions with the early growth response (EGR) protein LIN-29 to regulate the transcription of genes required for exiting the cell cycle, terminal differentiation, and the larval-to-adult transition. We suggest that DEAD-box helicase proteins function more generally during animal development to control the condensation of NAB proteins important in cell identity and that this mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. In mammals, such a mechanism might underlie terminal cell differentiation and when misregulated might promote cancerous growth.
<li>Series_overall_design: RNA-seq experiment characterizing the transcriptome of C. elegans lin-29, mab-10, and ddx-23 mutant adult animals and comparing their gene expression profiles to that of wild-type adult animals. Experiment was performed with three biological replicates per strain.
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
