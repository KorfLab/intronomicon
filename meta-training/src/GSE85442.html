<li>Series_title: Comparison of transcriptomes of sig-7 (RNAi) vs WT C. elegans early stage embryos by RNA-seq #-# HTS comparison of sig-7 (RNAi) vs WT C. elegans early stage embryos
<li>Series_summary: RNAi targeting a conserved C. elegans cyclophilin, sig-7, causes defective development and embryonic arrest consistent with a global defect in transcription. The goal of this study was to compare the transcript levels in sig-7(RNAi) embryos to those of L4440/RNAi control embryos to examine the global transcriptional effect caused by of loss of sig-7 function #-# This SuperSeries is composed of the SubSeries listed below.
<li>Series_overall_design: Examination of RNA levels using RNAseq in 2 replicate samples each of early embryos from sig-7(RNAi) and RNAi controls #-# Refer to individual Series
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing #-# Genome binding/occupancy profiling by high throughput sequencing #-# Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
