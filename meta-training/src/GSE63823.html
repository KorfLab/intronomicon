<li>Series_title: Analysis of intron sequences reveals hallmarks of circular RNA biogenesis in animals
<li>Series_summary: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a large class of animal RNAs. To investigate possible circRNA functions, it is important to understand circRNA biogenesis. Besides human Alu repeats, sequence features that promote exon circularization are largely unknown. We experimentally identified new circRNAs in C. elegans. Reverse complementary sequences between introns bracketing circRNAs were significantly enriched compared to linear controls. By scoring the presence of reverse complementary sequences in human introns we predicted and experimentally validated novel circRNAs. We show that introns bracketing circRNAs are highly enriched in RNA editing or hyper-editing events. Knockdown of the double-strand RNA editing ADAR1 enzyme significantly and specifically up-regulated circRNA expression. Together, our data support a model of animal circRNA biogenesis in which competing RNA:RNA interactions of introns form larger structures which promote circularization of embedded exons, while ADAR1 antagonizes circRNA expression by melting stems within these interactions. Thus, we assign a new function to ADAR1.
