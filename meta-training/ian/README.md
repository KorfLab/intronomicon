## Oddities ##

- ChIP-Seq
	- GSE100623
	- GSE100829
	- GSE79822
- dsRIP-seq
	- GSE79375
- Other
	- GSE100929 has 1 group of immunoprecipitated RNAs
	- GSE211846 has ATAC-Seq and small-RNA-Seq samples, 20 generation lineage
	- GSE229078 too big to organize (FACS neuron study)
	- GSE169137 another FACs neuron
- Timecourse
	- GSE122892 too long
	- GSE102537 when does an age series become an insult?


Maybe we should be sorting polysomal, cytoplasmic, monosomal...

- GSE122097
