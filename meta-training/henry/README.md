Henry's Training Notes
======================

### Thoughts and Notes

**Treating all RNAi treatments as a form of insult, even for controls.**

GSE57109 - "95% germline and 5% somatic gonadal tissue", specific enough or other?

GSE101647 - I is infected and C is control. Problem is the researcher seems to have labeled them wrong. Have to investigate further.

GSE138029 - Insult was heat shock

GSE151035 - Missing 5 GSMs, were they not long enough?

GSE168322 - If it works, I should eat this plant to live longer - Vicatia thibetica de Boiss.



### HTML Formatting Issue

Add New Group button adds new dl elements to end of HTML instead of within li element.

Not ideal.

Watch out when parsing. Pick out dl, dt, and dd elements across entire HTML.
