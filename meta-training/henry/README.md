Henry's Training Notes
======================

### Thoughts and Notes

**Treating all RNAi treatments as a form of insult, even for controls.**

GSE57109 - "95% germline and 5% somatic gonadal tissue", specific enough or other?

GSE101647 - I is infected and C is control. Problem is the researcher seems to have labeled them wrong. Have to investigate further.

GSE138029 - Insult was heat shock.

GSE151035 - Missing 5 GSMs, were they not long enough?

GSE173287 - I like how this experiment did the tissue they are interested in but also made a whole worm as ref.

GSE191294 - ~~Assuming glp-4(bn2) is not N2 WT.~~ ~~bn2 might be N2 var Bristol.~~ This one is super weird. Need help. bn2 is not Bristol. glp-4(bn2) is a gene. **Needs revision!**

GSE193444 - Insult was a lower temperature.

GSE211747 - Why is veh (vehicle) used here? ~~~What does "Maternal supplied vehicle" mean???~~~ Treating them as insults for now.

GSE211807 - ~~Helped me realize that bn2 might actually be N2 WT var Bristol from UK.~~ Bristol is N2 from UK, but bn2 has nothing to do with it. **Needs revision!**

GSE213222 - Too complicated with dissection and sorting. Need explanation.

GSE213367 - Very confusing, need help.

GSE228784 - normal growth medium or nematode growth media (NGM) vs 2% glucose as insult.

GSE232747 - Apparently Vehicle is a dedicated term. (9 mg/ml NaCl, pH 3.6) Treating as insults no problem.

GSE232747 - Treating tetraploid N2 as mutant.

GSE246966 - CeMbio is supposed to be "more natural" than OP50 for C. elegans. Is it insult or not? Treating it as insults for now. Source is **metagenomics**, need to flag this.

GSE248324 - Not specified source. Weird. Needs further investigation.

GSE79567 - Insult was heat-shock.

### Anomalies and Fun Stuff

GSE168322 - If it works, I should eat this plant to live longer - Vicatia thibetica de Boiss.

GSE189660 - They put their University name and street address in Chinese. That's new.

GSE232747 - GSM7373308 and GSM7373317 misspelled sample name. *Cispatin*-treated vs Cisplatin-treated.

### HTML Formatting Issue

Add New Group button adds new dl elements to end of HTML instead of within li element.

Not ideal.

Watch out when parsing. Pick out dl, dt, and dd elements across entire HTML.
