Henry's Training Notes
======================

### Thoughts

GSE57109 - "95% germline and 5% somatic gonadal tissue", specific enough or other?

GSE101647 - I is infected and C is control. Problem is the researcher seems to have labeled them wrong. Have to investigate further.

### HTML Formatting Issue

Add New Group button adds new dl elements to end of HTML instead of within li element.

Not ideal.

Watch out when parsing. Pick out dl, dt, and dd elements across entire HTML.
