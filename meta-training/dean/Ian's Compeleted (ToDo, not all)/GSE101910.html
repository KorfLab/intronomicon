<li>Series_title: Indole from commensal bacteria impact the aging transcriptome of C. elegans
<li>Series_summary: We report here that in C. elegans, indole induces a gene expression profile in aged animals reminiscent of that seen in the young, but which is distinct from that #-# associated with normal aging. Moreover, in older animals, indole induces genes associated with oogenesis, and, accordingly, extends fecundity and reproductive span.
<li>Series_overall_design: Whole animal trnascriptomic profile of old (12 day old adult) C. elegans growing on indole-positive E.coli, K12 or indole-negative mutant of K12, K12tnaA was obtained using RNA-Seq with Illumina Trueseq and #-# was compared with the profile of their younger (2 day old adult) counterparts #-# ------------------------------------------- #-# RNA was prepared from 12 day old adult (LATE) wild type worms (N2) grown on E.coli K12tnaA (tnaA) containing a deletion of #-# tryptophanase (necessary for indole production) #-# N2K12 means worms were grown in E coli K12 bacteria which is indole positive #-# EARLY means RNA was prepared from 2 day old adults. #-# AHRK12 means ahr-1(ia3) which has loss of function mutaion of ahr-1 gene was grown on K12 condition
<li>Series_type: Expression profiling by high throughput sequencing
